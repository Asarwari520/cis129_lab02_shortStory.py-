# my first project//cis129_lab02_shortStory.py_: this project is about discovering the githab envirnoment main repository where all project files or any changes exist in this file
an we mostly use bracnching, pull request to keep track and manage our codes and bring changes to the project, I already create my main project,and create a branch to further distribute 
my content,and i did bring some commit changes to the existance file.
My overall understanding of this project is to get to know the githab envirnments, to do besic commit changes to main files.
Here are some alteration has been made to this file:
